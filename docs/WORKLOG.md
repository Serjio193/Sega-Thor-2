# Worklog

## 2026-09-08/09 — Project bootstrap and T2-M0

### Repository foundation

- Created legal-safe GitHub foundation.
- Adapted evidence/verification rules from `Serjio193/Sega-Thor` for Saturn.
- Established one-method-at-a-time validation and explicit `ADOPT/ADOPT_PARTIAL/REJECT/DEFER` outcomes.
- Set T2-M0 as the first and only active workstream.

### T2-M0 results

Implemented `tools/disc/census_saturn_cd.py` using only Python standard library.

The tool:

- validates the supported single-track CUE shape;
- reads raw `MODE1/2352` sectors;
- parses Saturn boot header fields;
- parses ISO9660 directory records;
- hashes logical file extents without extracting retail files;
- emits legal-safe manifest/summary metadata.

Validation performed:

- independent census run 1;
- independent census run 2;
- `disc_manifest.tsv` identical between runs;
- summary output identical between runs;
- three synthetic unit tests pass.

Confirmed substrate:

- revision ID `thor2_ntsc_patched_fe11d2fb`;
- image SHA-256 `fe11d2fbda58d63300ef2265c555ce05bddf14d69fb7b73fc409e25c0ef6c0a8`;
- 33 ISO9660 files;
- manifest SHA-256 `19b56fd0fefa42c23edac055cd5e817a7a4834b7d7b423cef15a27de4bc80f49`.

Static executable-candidate work found:

- `0TH2.BIN` -> candidate High Work RAM base `0x06004000`;
- `TH2.LOW` -> strong static candidate Low Work RAM base `0x002DA000`;
- `TH2.LOW` relationship documented without declaring callee semantics confirmed.

### Decision

T2-M0 acceptance gate is satisfied using direct extent hashing instead of persisting extracted retail files. This reduces private-data duplication while retaining reproducibility.

### Next queued experiment

`T2-M1 — SaturnAutoRE dynamic-oracle validation`.

It must first prove one deterministic Thor 2 observation before any SaturnAutoRE component is adopted.
